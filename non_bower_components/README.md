# non\_bower\_components

Folder for components that cannot be installed through bower.

Firstly created for CSSUtilities, developed by brothercake, a very interesting
and misterious javascript frontend developer based at UK. (thank you very much
if you ever come accross these lines of code)

CSSUtilities is not available as bower package nor npm package and was written
quite far ago (2010) for web-ages but is a quite fascinating piece of art.
